# Receptivity

## Project Overview
This project explores the power of feature engineering in the context of opportune moment detection for interrupting smartphone users. It introduces a novel feature engineering approach named Contextual Filtered Features (CFF) and includes a robust machine learning setting for proper evaluation, such as using Leave-One-Subject-Out.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:

`git clone git@github.com:Jumabek/receptivity.git`
`cd receptivity`


2. Link your local Kemophone data folder:
`ln -s /home/juma/dataonssd/kemophone data/`

## Usage
Explore the Jupyter notebooks located in the `analysis` folder for insights into the data analysis and feature engineering process.
